## Summary

The app helps promote young voters to go and let their voices be heard. There is a drastic shortage of young people going to vote during elections. The app shows the deadlines for voting for each state. This includes registration deadline, online voting registration deadline, mail in deadlines as well. Also tells you if you're capable to vote as well in the register section. Promoting a healthy and consistent voting schedule for general and primary elections is very valuable to our democracy.
